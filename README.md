I am Ailed Citlalli Durán de la Rosa, a 17-year-old student passionate about programming and technology.

I am currently in the fourth semester of my Technical Programming career at CECYT 9 "Juan de Dios Bátiz", where I am part of the Technical Advisory Council representing the Programming Students. I also joined the Robotics Club, where I develop programming skills and am currently participating in two scientific proyects: a Delfín Project at UNIVA and a SIP project.

I find the possibilities in this area fascinating and enjoy collaborating in a team, considering myself an empathetic person who works on innovative solutions with a positive societal impact.

Encouraged by my parents, both system engineers, I have developed a strong interest in STEAM. I achieved an average of 9.9 in middle school and excelled in various competitions in elementary school, including first place in the Knowledge Olympiad at the Zone level, serving as my school's flag bearer for three years, and winning three English Spelling Bee contests.
